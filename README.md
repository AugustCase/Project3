-Overview/description of the project

I have created a todo list that you can add to. After adding to the todo list you can click on it to complete it and it will move to the completed section.
You can also click on it to put it back into the unfinished section. They will all show up in the all section. I have also added a contact page that you can submit.


-Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered

add tasks, complete them and view them under the all section. You can also click on them after they have been completed to mark them as unfinished.
There is also a contact page.


-Technologies Used ( .html, .css )

html css javascript react


-Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3)

1) upgrade the css and make it look nicer
2) connect the contact page to my email to receive comments
3) Add an option to bring back deleted todos
